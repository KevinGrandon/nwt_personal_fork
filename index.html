		<h3>Welcome to NWT</h3>
		<p>Node Web Toolkit (NWT) is a modern javascript web frameworks. NWT is a minimilist framework designed to give developers huge gains in efficiency compared to other frameworks. Nothing beats the functionality of NWT in such a small package.</p>

		<h3>Why should you use NWT?</h3>
		<p>NWT is the smallest framework out there. Coming in at under 5kb minified and gzipped, nothing is faster. There are other minimilist frameworks out there, but they lack the functionality of NWT. Also, NWT ships with an IE compatibile backup library when most of the competing minimilist libraries don't work.</p>
